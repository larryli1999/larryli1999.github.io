Hi! I'm Larry, an undergraduate student at [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) studying Mechatronics Engineering with Artificial Intelligence Option. Previously, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Huawei Canada and [Synapse Technology](https://www.synapsetechnology.com/). 

My research interest includes natural language processing, computer vision and robotics.

Fun fact: I got the CCOM performace certificate of [Erhu](https://www.lantungmusic.com/erhu/) (a traditional Chinese Instrument) in grade 10!
